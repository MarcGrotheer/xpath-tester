#XPath tester

XPath tester is a simple utility allowing you to test easily and quickly a XPath request.

An online preview version is available below. However, for lightning performances, please consider installing it on your own development server.
The only requirement is to deploy it on a server understanding PHP (DOMDocument module is used to execute your queries).
