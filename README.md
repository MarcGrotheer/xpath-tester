#XPath tester

XPath tester is a simple utility allowing you to test easily and quickly a XPath request.

There is currently no online version. Indeed, for lightning performances, you should consider deploying this app on your own development server. This way, network latencies will be negligible (as the process implies an AJAX request). The only requirement is having a server understanding PHP (DOMDocument module is used to execute your queries).
